    - Remove TPM state file in case error occurred
  - swtpm-localca:
    - Rewrite in python
    - Allow passing pkcs11 PIN using signingkey_password
    - Allow passing environment variables needed for pkcs11 modules using
      swtpm-localca.conf and format 'env:VARNAME=VALUE'.

version 0.4.0:
  - swtpm:
    - Invoke print capabilities after choosing TPM version
    - Add some recent syscalls to seccomp blacklist
  - swtpm_cert:
    - Support --ecc-curveid option to pass curve id
  - swtpm_setup & related scripts:
    - Rewrite swtpm_setup.sh in python with TPM 1.2 not requiring tcsd
      and TPM tools anymore; new dependencies:
      - python3: pip, cryptography, setuptools
      dropped dependencies for swtpm_setup:
      - tcsd, expect, tpm-tools (some still needed for pkcs11 tests)
    - Added support for RSA 3072 keys (for libtpms-0.8.0) and moved to
      ECC NIST P384 curve; default RSA key size is still 2048
    - Added support for --rsa-keysize option
    - Extend script to create a CA using a TPM 2 for signing
  - tests:
    - Use the IBM TSS2 v1.5.0's test suite
    - Add test case for loading of an NVRAM completely full with keys
    - Have softhsm_setup use temporary directory for softhsm config & state
    - various other improvements
  - man pages:
    - Improvements
  - build-sys:
    - clang: properly test for linker flag 'now' and 'relro'
    - Gentoo: explicitly link libswtpm_libtpms with -lcrypto
    - Ownership of /var/lib/swtpm-localca is now tss:root and
      mode flags 0750.

version 0.3.0:

      - Use writev_full rather than writev; fixes --vtpm-proxy EIO error
      - Only accept() new client ctrl connection if we have none (bugfix)
  - swtpm_setup & related scripts:
      - Support whitespaces in filenames and paths

      - Fix OIDs for TPM 2 platforms data
      - Option parsing cleanup
      - Support for passing password in various forms
      - Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_key_id API call for subj keyId
      - Support 64bit serial numbers read from command line
  - swtpm_ioctl:
      - Block SIGPIPE so we can get EPIPE on write()
  - swtpm_bios:
      - Block SIGPIPE so we can get EPIPE on write()
  - tests:
      - Increased timeouts and better support for running tests with
        executables run by valgrind
      - Allow running tests with choice of seccomp profile option
        (SWTPM_TEST_SECCOMP_OPT) to enable building for Ubuntu
      - Various cleanups & fixes
  - SELinux:
      - More rules added for support on F30
