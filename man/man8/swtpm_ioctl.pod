swtpm_ioctl - Utility for sending control commands to swtpm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm_ioctl [COMMAND] E<lt>deviceE<gt>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm_ioctl> implements a client tool for controlling the
I<swtpm_cuse> and I<swtpm> TPM software emulators, such as for example their
initialization and shutdown. Once it has been initialized, TPM commands can
be sent to it.

Note: The environment variable SWTPM_IOCTL_BUFFERSIZE can be set to the size
for the buffer for state blob transfer to use. If it is not set, the ioctl()
interface is used for transferring the state. This environment variable
is primarily used for testing purposes.

The following commands are supported:

=over 4

=item B<--tpm-device E<lt>deviceE<gt>>

Use the given device. The full path to the character device must be provided, such
as for example /dev/vtpm-200.

This option can be used instead of providing the device as the last parameter.

=item B<--tcp E<lt>serverE<gt>:E<lt>portE<gt>>

Connect to the given server and port; if no server is given, 127.0.0.1 is used;
if port is not given, the default port 6545 is used.

=item B<--unixio E<lt>pathE<gt>>

Connect to the given UnixIO path.

=item B<-c>

Get the capability flags indicating which commands are supported.

=item B<-i>

Send a hardware initialization signal to the swtpm_cuse/swtpm. Volatile
state previously written by the TPM will be read and the file automatically
delete.

=item B<-s>

Initiate a graceful shut down.

=item B<--stop>

Stop the swtpm_cuse/swtpm. This does not shut it down. The I<-i> command can again
be sent to it. After a stop it is also possible to load TPM stateblobs into the
TPM using the I<--load> command.

=item B<-e>

Get the tpmEstablished bit.

=item B<-r locality>

Reset the tpmEstablished bit using the given locality. Only localities 3 and 4 work.
This operation will not permanently change the localty that was previously set
using the I<-l> option.

=item B<-l locality>

Set the locality for the subsequent TPM commands.

=item B<-v>

Have the TPM write the volatile state to a file. Upon a TPM_Init (-i) the
TPM state will be read and the TPM can then resume operation without further
intialization.

=item B<-C>

Cancel an ongoing TPM command.

=item B<-h data>

Reset and extend PCR 17 with the hash of the given data. If data is the single
character '-', then all data are read from stdin.

=item B<--save E<lt>TPM state blob nameE<gt> E<lt>filenameE<gt> >

Save the TPM state blob into the given file. Valid TPM state blob
names are 'permanent', 'volatile', and 'savestate'.

Note that this command can be executed at any time. However, to retrieve
the latest volatile state, the I<-v> command should have been run
immediately before running this command. The savestate blob will only be
returned if a TPM_SaveState command was executed in the TPM (TPM 1.2).

=item B<--load E<lt>TPM state blob nameE<gt> E<lt>filenameE<gt>>

Load the given TPM state blob from the given file. Valid TPM state blob
names are 'permanent', 'volatile', and 'savestate'.

Note that this command can only be executed on a TPM that is shut down.
To then start the TPM with the uploaded state, the I<-i> command must
be issued.

=item B<-g>

Get configuration flags that for example indicate which keys (file encryption
or migration key) are in use by the TPM.

=item B<--info E<lt>flagE<gt>>

Get information about the TPM implementation in JSON format. The flag
I<TPMLIB_INFO_TPMSPECIFICATION>, which has the value 1, returns information
about the specification the TPM implementation followed. The flag
I<TPMLIB_INFO_TPMATTRIBUTES>, which has the value 2, returns information
about the manufacturer, model, and version of the TPM.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Start swtpm on port 10000 for the control port and emulate a TPM 1.2:

   #> swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=/tmp/myvtpm1 --log level=4 --ctrl type=tcp,port=10000 --server type=tcp,port=10001 --flags not-need-init

Get information about the TPM implementation in JSON:

   #> swtpm_ioctl --tcp :10000 --info 1
   {"TPMSpecification":{"family":"1.2","level":2,"revision":116}}
   #> swtpm_ioctl --tcp :10000 --info 2
   {"TPMAttributes":{"manufacturer":"id:00001014","version":"id:00740001","model":"swtpm"}}

Shut down the swtpm

   #> swtpm_ioctl --tcp :10000 -s
