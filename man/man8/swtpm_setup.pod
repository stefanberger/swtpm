=head1 NAME

swtpm_setup - Swtpm tool to simulate the manufacturing of a TPM 1.2 or 2.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm_setup [OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm_setup> is a tool that prepares the initial state for a libtpms-based
TPM.

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item B<--runas <userid>>

Use this userid to run swtpm_setup.sh as. Only 'root' can use this option.

=item B<--config <file>>

Path to configuration file containing the tool to use for creating
certificates; see also B<swtpm_setup.conf>

If this parameter is not provided, the default configuration file
will be used. The search order for the default configuration file is
as follows. If the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set,
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/swtpm_setup.conf will be used if available, otherwise if
the environment variable HOME is set, ${HOME}/swtpm_setup.conf
will be used if available. If none of the previous ones are available, /etc/swtpm_setup.conf
will be used.

=item B<--tpm-state <dir>> or B<--tpmstate <dir>>

Path to a directory where the TPM's state will be written into;
this is a mandatory argument

=item B<--tpm <path to executable>>

Path to the TPM executable; this is an optional argument and
by default the swtpm executable found in the PATH will be used.

=item B<--tpm2>

Do setup on a TPM 2; by default a TPM 1.2 is setup.

=item B<--createek>

Create an endorsement key (EK).

=item B<--allow-signing>

Create an EK that can sign. This option requires --tpm2.

Note that the TCG specification "EK Credential Profile For TPM Family 2.0; Level 0"
suggests in its section on "EK Usage" that "the Endorsement Key can be a
created as a decryption or signing key." However, some platforms will
not accept an EK as a signing key, or as a signing and encryption key, and
therefore this option should be used very carefully.

=item B<--decryption>

Create an EK that can be used for key encipherment. This is the default
unless --allow-signing is passed. This option requires --tpm2.

=item B<--ecc>

Create elliptic curve crypto (ECC) keys; by default RSA keys are generated.

=item B<--take-ownership>

Take ownership; this option implies --createek. This option is only available for TPM 1.2.

=item B<--ownerpass  <password>>

Provide custom owner password; default is 'ooo'. This option is only available for TPM 1.2.

=item B<--owner-well-known>

Use a password of all zeros (20 bytes of zeros) as the owner password.
This option is only available for TPM 1.2.

=item B<--srkpass <password>>

Provide custom SRK password; default is 'sss'. This option is only available for TPM 1.2.

=item B<--srk-well-known>

Use a password of all zeros (20 bytes of zeros) as the SRK password.
This option is only available for TPM 1.2.

=item B<--create-ek-cert>

Create an EK certificate; this implies --createek.

=item B<--create-platform-cert>

Create a platform certificate; this implies --create-ek-cert.

=item B<--lock-nvram>

Lock NVRAM access to all NVRAM locations that were written to.

=item B<--display>

At the end display as much info as possible about the configuration
of the TPM.

=item B<--logfile <logfile>>

The logfile to log to. By default logging goes to stdout and stderr.

=item B<--keyfile <keyfile>>

The key file contains an ASCII hex key consisting of 32 hex digits with an
optional leading '0x'. This is the key to be used by the TPM emulator
for encrypting the state of the TPM. 

=item B<--keyfile-fd <file descriptor>>

Like B<--keyfile> but the key will be read from the file descriptor.

=item B<--pwdfile <passphrase file>>

The passphrase file contains a passphrase from which the TPM emulator
will derive the encyrption key from and use the key for encrypting the TPM
state.

=item B<--pwdfile-fd <file descriptor>>

Like B<--pwdfile> but the passphrase will be read from the file descriptor.

=item B<--ciper <cipher>>

The cipher may be either aes-cbc or aes-128-cbc for 128 bit AES encryption,
or aes-256-cbc for 256 bit AES encryption. The same cipher must be used
on the I<swtpm> command line later on.

=item B<--overwrite>

Overwrite existing TPM state. All previous state will be erased.
If this option is not given and an existing state file is found, an error
code is returned.

=item B<--not-overwrite>

Do not overwrite existing TPM state. If existing TPM state is found, the
program ends without an error.

=item B<--vmid <VM ID>>

Optional VM ID that can be used to keep track of certificates issued
for VMs (or containers). This parameter will be passed through to the tool
used for creating the certificates and may be required by that tool.

=item B<--pcr-banks <PCR banks>>

Optional comma-separated list of PCR banks to activate. Providing '-'
allows a user to skip the selection and activates all PCR banks. By default
the sha1 and sha256 banks are activated.

=item B<--swtpm_ioctl <executable>>

Pass the path to the swtpm_ioctl executable. By default the swtpm_ioctl
in the PATH is used.

=item B<--tcsd-system-ps-file <file>>

This option is deprecated and has no effect (since v0.4).

=item B<--rsa-keysize <keysize>> (since v0.4)

This option allows to pass the size of a TPM 2 RSA EK key, such as 2048
or 3072. The supported keysizes for a TPM 2 can be queried for using
the I<--print-capabilities> option. The default size is 2048 bits for
both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2. If 'max' is passed, the largest possible key
size is used.

=item B<--print-capabilities> (since v0.2)

Print capabilities that were added to swtpm_setup after version 0.1.
The output may contain the following:

    {
      "type": "swtpm_setup",
      "features": [
        "cmdarg-keyfile-fd",
        "cmdarg-pwdfile-fd",
        "tpm2-rsa-keysize-2048",
        "tpm2-rsa-keysize-3072",
        "tpm12-not-need-root"
      ]
    }

The meaning of the feature verbs is as follows:

=over 4

=item B<cmdarg-key-fd>

The I<--keyfile-fd> option is supported.

=item B<cmdarg-pwd-fd>

The I<--pwdfile-fd> option is supported.

=item B<tpm2-rsa-keysize-2048, ...>

The shown RSA key sizes are supported for a TPM 2's EK key. If none of the
tpm2-rsa-keysize verbs is shown then only RSA 2048 bit keys are supported.

=item B<tpm12-not-need-root> (since 0.4.0)

This option implies that any user can setup a TPM 1.2. Previously only root
or the 'tss' user, depending on configuration and availability of this account,
could do that.

=head1 EXAMPLE USAGE

To simulate manufacturing of a TPM, one would typically run the following command:

  #> sudo swtpm_setup --tpmstate /tmp/mytpm1/ \
      --create-ek-cert --create-platform-cert --lock-nvram

Note: since v0.4 TPM 1.2 setup does not require root rights anymore.

Any user can also simulate the manufacturing of a TPM using the
swtpm-localca plugin. The following example assumes that the user has
set the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME as follows (using bash for
example):

    export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config

Note: The XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is part of the XDG Base Directory
Specification.

The following configuration files need to be created:

~/.config/swtpm_setup.conf:

    # Program invoked for creating certificates
    create_certs_tool= /usr/share/swtpm/swtpm-localca
    create_certs_tool_config = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/swtpm-localca.conf
    create_certs_tool_options = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/swtpm-localca.options

~/.config/swtpm-localca.conf:

    statedir = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/var/lib/swtpm-localca
    signingkey = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/var/lib/swtpm-localca/signkey.pem
    issuercert = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/var/lib/swtpm-localca/issuercert.pem
    certserial = ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/var/lib/swtpm-localca/certserial

~/.config/swtpm-localca.options:

    --platform-manufacturer Fedora
    --platform-version 2.12
    --platform-model QEMU

Note: The tool swtpm-create-user-config-files can be used to create such
files (with different content):

  #> /usr/share/swtpm/swtpm-create-user-config-files
  Writing /home/stefanb/.config/swtpm_setup.conf.
  Writing /home/stefanb/.config/swtpm-localca.conf.
  Writing /home/stefanb/.config/swtpm-localca.options.

The following commands now create a TPM 2 with an EK and platform
certificate. The state of the TPM 2 will be stored in the directory
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/mytpm1.

  #> mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/mytpm1
  #> swtpm_setup --tpm2 --tpmstate ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/mytpm1 \
      --create-ek-cert --create-platform-cert --lock-nvram
