=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm_cert [OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm_cert> is a local CA tool for creating X.509v3 certificates for the TPM's
Endorsement Key. The reason for this specific tool is that it works  without access
to the Endorsement Key's private key. Typically tools require either a self-signed
certificate request or access to the private key to issue a certificate.
This tool works with only the public key part.

=item B<--pubkey <filename>>

can be used in place of the --pubkey option.
