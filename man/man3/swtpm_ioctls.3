\& };
.Ve
.Sp
In the request the state_flags field allows to set the
\&\fB\s-1PTM_STATE_FLAG_DECRYPT\s0\fR flag to retrieve decrypted \s-1TPM\s0 state in case
the \s-1TPM\s0's state was written in encrypted form.
.Sp
The type field allows to choose one of the \s-1TPM\s0's state blobs, and must be
one of \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_PERMANENT\s0\fR, \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_VOLATILE\s0\fR, and
\&\fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_SAVESTATE\s0\fR.
.Sp
The offset field indicates at what offset to read the data from. Subsequent
state transfers must advance the offset field to the next byte to be read.
If the \fIread()\fR interface is used the offset will be advanced automatically.
.Sp
The response returns a \s-1TPM\s0 error code in the tpm_result field.
.Sp
The state_flags field in the response indicates whether the returned
blob is encrypted.
.Sp
The totlength field indicates the total length of the state blob.
.Sp
The length field indicates the number of valid bytes in the data field.
.Sp
If necessary, subsequent state blob transfers must be done using this
ioctl or using the \fIread()\fR call on the file descriptor. All state
must be transferred before the \s-1TPM\s0 will accept commands again.
.IP "\fB\s-1PTM_SET_STATEBLOB,\s0 ptm_setstate\fR" 4
.IX Item "PTM_SET_STATEBLOB, ptm_setstate"
This ioctl is used to transfer one of the \s-1TPM\s0's stateblob to the \s-1TPM.\s0
.Sp
The ptm_setstate data structure looks as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\& struct ptm_setstate {

\&        struct {

\&        } resp; /* response */
\&    } u;
\& };
.Ve
.Sp
The state_flags field indicates whether the provided state is encrypted.
In case it is encrypted, a migration key must have been provided to the
\&\s-1TPM\s0 for it to be able to decrypt the state.
.Sp
The type field indicates which one of the \s-1TPM\s0's state blobs is being set.
It must be either one of \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_PERMANENT\s0\fR,
\&\fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_VOLATILE\s0\fR, and \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_SAVESTATE\s0\fR.
.Sp
The length field indicates the number of bytes of state blob data in the
data field. To transfer the state blob using the \fIwrite()\fR call, set the
length to 0.
.Sp
The response returns a \s-1TPM\s0 error code in the tpm_result field.
.IP "\fB\s-1PTM_STOP,\s0 ptm_res\fR" 4
.IX Item "PTM_STOP, ptm_res"
This ioctl is used to stop the \s-1TPM.\s0 In contrast to a \s-1TPM\s0 shut down,
the stopping of the \s-1TPM\s0 only halts its operations without terminating
the \s-1TPM\s0 process. The \s-1TPM\s0 can restart operation with the \fB\s-1PTM_INIT\s0\fR
ioctl.
.Sp
A \s-1TPM\s0 result code is returned in pmt_res.
.IP "\fB\s-1PTM_GET_CONFIG,\s0 ptm_getconfig\fR" 4
.IX Item "PTM_GET_CONFIG, ptm_getconfig"
This ioctl is used to retrieve the \s-1TPM\s0's current configuration.
.Sp
The ptm_getconfig data structure looks as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\& struct ptm_getconfig {
\&    union {
\&        struct {
\&            ptm_res tpm_result;
\&            uint32_t flags;
\&        } resp; /* response */
\&    } u;
\& };
.Ve
.Sp
A \s-1TPM\s0 result code is returned in the tpm_result field.
.Sp
The flags field holds individual flags that indicate whether a file
encryption key is used (\fB\s-1PTM_CONFIG_FLAG_FILE_KEY\s0\fR)
and whether a migration key is used
(\fB\s-1PTM_CONFIG_FLAG_MIGRATION_KEY\s0\fR).
