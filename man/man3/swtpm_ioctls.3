.SH "NAME"
Description of the ioctl's of the CUSE TPM (swtpm_cuse) and control commands
used by the control channel over socket interface.
.SH "SYNOPSYS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSYS"
\&\fB#include <tpm_ioctl.h>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1CUSE TPM\s0 implements an ioctl interface on the \s-1CUSE TPM\s0's character device.
The ioctl's are used for out-of-band control of various \s-1TPM\s0 operations,
such as its intialization, resetting, and state migration. The control channel
over \s-1TCP\s0 or UnixIO sockets uses control commands for these operations.
.PP
The following is an enumeration of the supported ioctl's and control commands,
along with the names of the data structure types. All ioctl's and control
commands return a \s-1TPM\s0 error code in their response. Ioctl's are prefixed with
\&\fI\s-1PTM\s0\fR and control commands are prefixed with \fI\s-1CMD\s0\fR.
.PP
In case of the ioctl interface, the pointer to a command's data structure is
passed as the 2nd parameter to the \fIioctl()\fR function. The fields in the command's
data structure are to be fill out in host endianess format.
.PP
In case of control commands, the command code must be encoded as a 4 byte
interger preceding the command's data structure. Command code and data must be
written in big endian format.

\&    } u;
\& };
.Ve
.Sp
In the request the state_flags field allows to set the
\&\fB\s-1PTM_STATE_FLAG_DECRYPT\s0\fR flag to retrieve decrypted \s-1TPM\s0 state in case
the \s-1TPM\s0's state was written in encrypted form.
.Sp
The type field allows to choose one of the \s-1TPM\s0's state blobs, and must be
one of \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_PERMANENT\s0\fR, \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_VOLATILE\s0\fR, and
\&\fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_SAVESTATE\s0\fR.
.Sp
The offset field indicates at what offset to read the data from. Subsequent
state transfers must advance the offset field to the next byte to be read.
If the \fIread()\fR interface is used the offset will be advanced automatically.
.Sp
The response returns a \s-1TPM\s0 error code in the tpm_result field.
.Sp
The state_flags field in the response indicates whether the returned
blob is encrypted.
.Sp
The totlength field indicates the total length of the state blob.
.Sp
The length field indicates the number of valid bytes in the data field.
.Sp
If necessary, subsequent state blob transfers must be done using this
ioctl or using the \fIread()\fR call on the file descriptor. All state
must be transferred before the \s-1TPM\s0 will accept commands again.
.IP "\fB\s-1PTM_SET_STATEBLOB / CMD_SET_STATEBLOB,\s0 ptm_setstate\fR" 4
.IX Item "PTM_SET_STATEBLOB / CMD_SET_STATEBLOB, ptm_setstate"

\&        } resp; /* response */
\&    } u;
\& };
.Ve
.Sp
The state_flags field indicates whether the provided state is encrypted.
In case it is encrypted, a migration key must have been provided to the
\&\s-1TPM\s0 for it to be able to decrypt the state.
.Sp
The type field indicates which one of the \s-1TPM\s0's state blobs is being set.
It must be either one of \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_PERMANENT\s0\fR,
\&\fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_VOLATILE\s0\fR, and \fB\s-1PTM_BLOB_TYPE_SAVESTATE\s0\fR.
.Sp
The length field indicates the number of bytes of state blob data in the
data field. To transfer the state blob using the \fIwrite()\fR call, set the
length to 0.
.Sp
The response returns a \s-1TPM\s0 error code in the tpm_result field.
.IP "\fB\s-1PTM_STOP / CMD_STOP,\s0 ptm_res\fR" 4
.IX Item "PTM_STOP / CMD_STOP, ptm_res"
This command is used to stop the \s-1TPM.\s0 In contrast to a \s-1TPM\s0 shut down,
the stopping of the \s-1TPM\s0 only halts its operations without terminating
the \s-1TPM\s0 process. The \s-1TPM\s0 can restart operation with the \fB\s-1PTM_INIT\s0\fR
ioctl.
.Sp
A \s-1TPM\s0 result code is returned in ptm_res.
