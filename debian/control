Description: Libtpms-based TPM emulator
 The swtpm package provides TPM emulators that listen for TPM commands
 on sockets, character devices, or CUSE devices.

Description: Common libraries for TPM emulators
 The swtpm-libs package provides the shared libraries for the swtpm
 and swtpm-cuse packages.

# linux-image-extra
Description: TPM emulator with CUSE interface
 The swtpm-cuse package provides a CUSE TPM emulator. This emulator
 creates a character device in the /dev directory to which applications
 can send TPM commands. Out-of-band control of the CUSE TPM is through
 ioctl's on that device. The swtpm_ioctl command line utility from the
 swtpm-tools package can be used for that.

Description: Include files for the TPM emulator's CUSE interface
 The swtpm-dev package provides include files for developing clients
 controlling the CUSE TPM through ioctls.

Package: swtpm-tools
Architecture: any
Description: Tools for the TPM emulator
 The swtpm-tools package contains the following types of tools:
  - swtpm_bios: Tool for initializing the TPM
  - swtpm_ioctl: Tool for controlling the CUSE TPM
  - swtpm_setup: Tool for creating the initial state of the TPM; this
      tool basically simulates TPM manufacturing where certificates are
      written into the NVRAM of the TPM
  - swtpm_cert: Creation of certificates for the TPM (x509)
