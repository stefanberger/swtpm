/*
 * daemon(3) is racy because it fork()s and exits in the parent before the
 * child can get ready to provide its services.
 *
 * Not every daemon can set up services before calling daemon(3), as some
 * APIs are not fork-safe and must be called in the child-side of the
 * daemon(3)'s fork() calls.
 *
 * Even if a daemon can set up services before calling daemon(3), it will not
 * be able to write the correct PID into a pidfile until after daemon(3)
 * returns.
 *
 * E.g.,
 *
 *  #!/bin/bash
 *
 *  # Start a service:
 *  some-serviced --daemon --pid=... ...
 *
 *  # Call it:
 *  call-some-service ping || echo "oops, we won the race but lost the game"
 *
 * To address this we split daemon(3) into two functions, daemonize_prep() and
 * daemonize_finish().  A daemon program should call daemonize_prep() early
 * when it knows it will have to daemonize (e.g., because of a --daemon
 * command-line option), then it should do all the setup required to start
 * providing its services, then it should call daemonize_finish().
 *
 * These two functions do all that daemon(3) does, but in two phases so that
 * the original process that calls daemonize_prep() does not exit until the
 * service is ready.
 *
 * daemonize_prep() calls fork(), setsid(), and then forks again, and returns
 * in the grandchild, but exits in the original and middle processes when the
 * grandchild calls daemonize_finish().
 *
 * How to use this:
 *
 *  if (daemonize) {
 *      pid_t old_pid, new_pid;
 *
 *      old_pid = getpid();
 *      if (daemonize_prep() == -1)
 *          err(1, "Failed to daemonize");
 *
 *      // We're now in a grandchild, but the original parent should still be
 *      // waiting.
 *      new_pid = getpid();
 *      assert(old_pid != new_pid);
 *  }
 *
 *  // setup sockets, listen() on them, etc...
 *  my_setup_service_and_listen_on_sockets();
 *
 *  // Tell the waiting parent and grandparent that we're ready:
 *  // (doing this even if daemonize_prep() wasn't called is ok)
 *  daemonize_finish();
 *
 *  // daemonize_finish() did not fork() again:
 *  assert(new_pid == getpid());
 *
 * Note: the processes that exit will use _exit().  The process that
 * daemonize_prep() returns to should be able to use exit().

 * Prepare to daemonize.  When ready, the caller should call

 * to service clients.
 *
 * This forks a grandchild and returns in the grandchild
 * but exits in the parent and grandparent, but only once the child calls
 * daemonize_finish() (or exits/dies, whichever comes first).

 * Because the parent side of the fork() calls _exit(), the child can exit().
